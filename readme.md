# Milestone 1 Project: The Island of Portland

I thought I would do a website on somewhere near my hometown. This is becuase I originally decided to do it on flowers, but know very little about flowers. Whereas portland I know about and can easily produce subjects for pages. Furthermore, it is a very beautiful and photographic location so my webpage is naturally visually appealing.  Why make the website on Portland?  Portland is an underrated outrageously different small Island that deserves more spotlight than it currently has.  Wikipedia may have some information and there are some websites out there but most are laced in with Weymouth and this website is purely on Portland and what it offers.  It truly is one of my favourite places in the world and I genuinely feel the internet isn't serving its purpose fully when you search 'portland uk' in google.  I wouldn't say this is mobile first as a smaller screen doesn't do the Island full justice.  It is that picturesque.  However the carousels, you tube videos and flip cards all function on a mobile screen and look great.  For example the drone video on the walks page on a mobile would be hard to fully watch on a mobile screen, there is alot of scenery you would miss.
